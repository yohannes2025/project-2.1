## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion
This section outlines the purpose of the scientific calculator, its target audience, and the primary goals of its functionality. It includes discussions on user needs and the problem-solving approach.

### User Stories
- **As a student**, I want a calculator capable of performing trigonometric and logarithmic functions to help with my assignments.
- **As an engineer**, I need a tool to handle precise calculations for my projects.
- **As a general user**, I require a simple interface to perform basic and advanced calculations easily.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The interface features a professional colour palette:
- **Primary Colours**: Navy blue for borders and buttons.
- **Secondary Colours**: Light grey for the background.
- **Accent Colours**: Green for "Calculate" actions and red for "Reset."

### Typography
Fonts are chosen for clarity and readability:
- **Primary Font**: Arial for numerical input and results.
- **Secondary Font**: Roboto for labels and informational text.

### Imagery
Minimal imagery ensures a clean design. Icons are used for buttons to visually represent their functions.

### Wireframes
Wireframes depict responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices.

### Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced Calculations: Trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.
- Memory Functions: Store, recall, and clear memory values.
- Error Handling: Provides clear feedback for invalid input.

### Accessibility
Designed to be inclusive:
- Fully keyboard-navigable interface.
- Screen reader support for visually impaired users.
- High contrast mode for better visibility.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
